# PCBSCalc Source Code
Source code of PCBSCalc with problematic content & source code removed.

This is the final farewell gift to PCBS Community. I removed all problematic code which belongs to PUC_Snakeman and donation notice is removed completely.

You may use it in your future calculator project, but I don't recommend making another clone of PCBSCalc.

Remember that you can't still use PCBSCalc name and logo, because of two reasons:

- It belongs to Mystic Moonlight
- I don't want to make second trauma with that name

Thank you for everything. Without you, we wouldn't exist.
